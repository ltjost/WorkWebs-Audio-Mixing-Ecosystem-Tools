v202601114a is the lkatest version!
This tool is also described at WorkWebs.com  
Cue management tools are incldued for building and running cues using OSC to control one or more instance of REAPER,
X/M32, Behringer Wing systems.
Cues are text files using simple syntax.
Each Release has its own ZIP file in the repository.
Each release incldues an example use of the tools...either using REAPER, X/M32, WING or a combination of these.
The CUE running script can run cues you can write for other OSC controlled solutions.
The Cue system only works on WIndows systems and is written in Cmd scripting to keep it safe and to eliminate the need to install programs.
The system includes Bitfocus Companion config that can be run on any web connected device with /tablet to manage cue execution via the Vicreo Listener.
Included are Open Stage Control configs for REAPER
Included are Mixing Station configs for WING and X32
Inlcuded are web scripts for REAPER to manage track muting and level adjustments
Each new release adds some functionality, but in recent releases old Cues work with new Cues...but the old scripts also still work.
Enjoy!
